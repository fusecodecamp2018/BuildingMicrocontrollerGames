# Exercise 3.1
In this exercise we'll display a scrolling message on the micro:bit LED grid.

### step 1
From the **Basic** menu, drag the **forever** block into the editor space. The **forever** block will execute commands over and over... forever!

From the **Basic** menu, drag the **show string** block into the **forever** block. Click on the *Hello!* text to change it to *Hello World!* The **show string** block will display scrolling text in the LED grid.

Once you are finished, make sure your micro:bit is plugged into your computer via USB. Click the **Download** button to load your program onto the micro:bit

Here is what your program should look like in the code editor:
