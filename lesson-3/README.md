# Lesson 3
In this lesson we'll learn about some of the basic features of your micro:bit. We'll create a few simple programs, load them onto your micro:bit to experiment, and brainstorm on how we can use these features to build something new.

### Exercise 3.1
In this exercise we'll display a scrolling message on the micro:bit LED grid.
