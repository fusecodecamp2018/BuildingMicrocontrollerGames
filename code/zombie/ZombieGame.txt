/***********
 * Zombie game
 ***********
 * A strategy game of hidden information and social interaction where humans try to defeat zombies
 * by forming teams of larger size than the zombie horde. Only zombies know they are zombies
 * and try to convince humans to join their “team”.
 *
 * Rules:
 ***********
 * Players join a master game via initial pairing and are each assigned a unique team letter A-Z
 * Once pairing is complete the game begins and 1/3 of the players are assigned to be zombies.
 * The game begins with a 5 second period of players hiding their screens and the zombies are told which players are zombies.
 * After this point the screen always shows a player’s team letter.
 * 
 * Once per game a player can join a team by pairing to another player and taking on that player’s identifier.
 * For example player A can join player B and after that point both players screens will show B.
 * Similarly player C could join team B by pairing to either of the members.
 * Note: the joining player will not know until the end of the game if they’ve joined a human team
 * or been infected and will be unknowingly recruiting for the zombie horde.
 * 
 * The game is over when either the zombie horde or a single human team contains the majority of players and wins the game.
 * Note: the 2 zombies do not need to join a single team, they can independently expand the horde by growing their own teams.
 * 
 * Control:
 ***********
 * Press A+B to enter master mode (1 per game)
 *
 * Wait for players to be paired. The number of paired player will display on screen.
 * An icon will appear on each player's screen.
 * 
 * The master should press A+B to start the game.  The game will end itself when appropriate.
 *
 * The master can also press A+B again to stop the game.
