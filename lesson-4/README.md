# Lesson 4
In Lesson 4, we'll learn about the basics of communication using your micro:bit's Radio and Bluetooth capabilities. We will spend a bit more time on Radio communication and we'll build a simple example with a partner. Finally, we'll load a simple radio-enabled game onto your micro:bit. We'll spend some time talking about the structure of the game and we'll spend some time playing the game as a group.

### Exercise 4.1
In this exercise we'll build a simple program that uses your micro:bit's Radio.

### Exercise 4.2
In this exercise we'll load a simple game onto your micro:bit that uses the Radio.
