# Lesson 5
In Lesson 5, we'll learn about using blocks in building games for microbit controller. We will do a follow along group coding execrcise and build a fun game together. Finally, we'll load a this game onto your micro:bit. We'll spend some time talking about the structure of the game and we'll spend some time playing the game as a group.

### Exercise 5.1
In this exercise we'll learn about makecode game blocks.
